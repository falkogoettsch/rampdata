Title: Finds data and places data for the RAMP project.
Version: 0.1.0
Author: adolgert@uw.edu
Maintainer: Drew Dolgert <adolgert@uw.edu>
Description: We work on a cluster and on desktops, and we use a lot of data.
    That data needs to come from the cluster, go to the cluster, or come from
    external sources. This library organizes that data so that everybody
    can get to what they need or know where to put it so that other team
    members can find it.
